## TikTok

TikTok [declared on October 2019](https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/understanding-our-policies-around-paid-ads):
>[...] we have chosen not to allow political ads on TikTok. Any paid ads that come into the community need to fit the standards for our platform, and the nature of paid political ads is not something we believe fits the TikTok platform experience. To that end, we will not allow paid ads that promote or oppose a candidate, current leader, political party or group, or issue at the federal, state, or local level – including election-related ads, advocacy ads, or issue ads.

Political ads are also listed as prohibited content in the [advertising guidelines for US and EU](https://support.tiktok.com/en/privacy-safety/advertising-guidelines-for-the-united-states-default).

## Whatsapp

Currently Whatsapp does not features ads.

## Tencent (WeChat, QQ, Qzone, ...)

In a controversy that occurred during the 2019 Canadian federal election, Tencent made the statement that it doesn't accept political ads. ([source 1](https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/wechat-election-social-media-1.5318589), [source 2](https://election.ctvnews.ca/truth-tracker-are-political-posts-on-wechat-in-violation-of-canada-s-election-laws-1.4641460)).
